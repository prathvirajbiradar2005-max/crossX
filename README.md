# 💰 CrossX — Money Muling Detection Engine

A **graph-theory-based** web application that detects money muling patterns in financial transaction data using cycle detection, smurfing analysis, shell-network tracing, and entropy-based scoring.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Money muling** is one of the fastest-growing methods of financial crime worldwide. Criminals recruit individuals — knowingly or unknowingly — to transfer illegally obtained money through their personal bank accounts. This is done to disguise the origin of illicit funds and make them appear legitimate, a process known as **money laundering**.

### Why is this a critical problem?

- **Scale:** According to Europol and FinCEN, money mule networks facilitate _billions of dollars_ in illicit transactions every year.
- **Recruitment:** Criminals exploit students, job seekers, and immigrants by offering "easy money" or fake employment. Over **90%** of money mule transactions are linked to cybercrime.
- **Detection difficulty:** Traditional rule-based banking systems rely on simple thresholds (e.g., flag any transaction above $10,000). Criminals exploit this by **structuring** transactions just below thresholds and routing money through multiple accounts in complex chains.
- **Victim impact:** Money muling directly enables fraud, ransomware payouts, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. Mules themselves face criminal prosecution, even if unknowingly involved.

### How do money mule networks actually operate?

A typical money muling operation involves **three stages**:

1. **Placement** — Illicit money enters the banking system. Criminals divide large sums into smaller deposits across multiple mule accounts to avoid triggering automatic reporting thresholds (a technique called **smurfing**).

2. **Layering** — The money is moved rapidly through a chain of mule accounts, often across different banks and countries. Each hop makes it harder to trace. Common layering techniques include:
   - **Circular routing:** A → B → C → A (money flows in loops to obscure origin)
   - **Fan-in / Fan-out:** Many accounts funnel into one collection hub, which then distributes to many outgoing accounts
   - **Pass-through relays:** Shell accounts that receive and immediately forward funds, retaining near-zero balance
   - **Decreasing-amount chains:** Each hop deducts a small "commission," e.g., $10,000 → $9,500 → $9,000

3. **Integration** — The laundered money is withdrawn or spent, now appearing to have a legitimate source.

### How was this traditionally detected?

| Traditional Approach | Limitation |
|---------------------|------------|
| Fixed threshold rules (flag tx > $10K) | Easily defeated by structuring deposits just below the threshold |
| Manual investigation by compliance teams | Extremely slow, expensive, and cannot scale to millions of transactions |
| Keyword and blacklist matching | Only catches known bad actors, misses new mule networks entirely |
| Single-transaction analysis | Cannot see multi-hop chains or circular patterns — analyzes each transaction in isolation |

> **The core gap:** Traditional systems look at _individual transactions_ in isolation. They cannot detect patterns that emerge only when you analyze the _network of relationships_ between accounts — cycles, fan structures, relay chains, and timing correlations.

## 💡 Our Solution — How CrossX Works

CrossX addresses this gap by modeling all transactions as a **directed graph** (network) and applying **graph-theory algorithms** to detect the structural patterns that money mule networks inevitably create.

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Graph Construction:** Every transaction becomes a directed edge from sender → receiver in a NetworkX `MultiDiGraph`. Attributes include amount, timestamp, and transaction ID. A collapsed `DiGraph` is also built for cycle detection.

2. **Cycle Detection (DFS):** Uses depth-first search to find all directed cycles of length 3–5. Circular fund routing (A → B → C → A) is the most classic money muling signature — in legitimate banking, money almost never flows in a perfect circle back to the originator.

3. **Smurfing Analysis:** Identifies **fan-in hubs** (10+ senders → 1 receiver) and **fan-out hubs** (1 sender → 10+ receivers). Also checks for low amount variance and timing clustering, which indicate coordinated structuring.

4. **Shell Network Detection:** Finds relay/pass-through accounts with near-zero net balance (money in ≈ money out), low degree, and rapid forwarding (< 24 hours). These "shell" accounts exist only to relay funds and add hops.

5. **Velocity Analysis:** Detects accounts where money is received and forwarded within minutes — a strong indicator of automated mule activity.

6. **Layering Detection:** Identifies decreasing-amount chains where each hop deducts a small commission (e.g., $10K → $9.5K → $9K), a common layering technique.

7. **Structuring Detection:** Flags transactions clustered just below reporting thresholds (e.g., multiple $9,900 transactions to avoid the $10,000 reporting requirement).

8. **Community & SCC Clustering:** Uses graph community detection to find tightly connected groups with heavy internal transfers — potential mule rings operating as a unit.

9. **New Account Burst:** Detects freshly created accounts that suddenly show high transaction volume — a red flag for newly recruited mules.

10. **Entropy Analysis:** Calculates Shannon entropy of each account's counterparty distribution. Low entropy (< 1.5) means an account transacts with very few counterparties in a predictable pattern — suspicious for relay behavior.

### Scoring & False-Positive Control

Each account receives a **suspicion score (0–100)** by summing weighted points from all 10 detection patterns. A **Trust Multiplier** discount (up to 40%) is applied to high-degree nodes (≥ 50 connections) with stable timing and no cycle participation — these are likely legitimate merchants, not mules.

### Why Graph Theory?

> Money mule networks are inherently **graph problems**. The criminal patterns (cycles, fan structures, relay chains) are **topological structures** in the transaction network. No amount of single-transaction rule checking can detect a cycle — you must analyze the graph. CrossX brings this graph-aware intelligence to financial crime detection.

## 🔍 Detection Patterns

### 1. Circular Fund Routing (Cycles)
Detects directed cycles of length 3–5 using DFS. The classic mule signature:
**A → B → C → A**.

### 2. Smurfing / Structuring
- **Fan-In:** 10+ senders → 1 receiver (collection hub)
- **Fan-Out:** 1 sender → 10+ receivers (distribution hub)
- Time-window clustering and amount variance analysis

### 3. Layered Shell Networks
Traces relay chains where intermediate nodes:
- Have near-zero net balance (money in ≈ money out)
- Low total degree (exist only to relay funds)
- Rapid forwarding window (< 24 hours)

### 4. Suspicion Scoring (0–100 Scale)

This is a **deterministic, rule-based pattern-matching engine** — not a trained ML model. Each account receives a suspicion score by summing weighted points across 10 detection patterns:

| # | Factor                  | Max Weight | How It's Detected |
|---|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Cycle Participation    | 40 pts    | Circular money flow (A→B→C→A). First cycle = 30 pts, each extra adds 5 |
| 2 | Smurfing Hub           | 30 pts    | Fan-in (many→one) or fan-out (one→many) concentration. +5 for low variance, +5 for timing |
| 3 | Rapid Pass-Through     | 20 pts    | Account in velocity chain — money in→out within minutes |
| 4 | Layering (Decreasing)  | 20 pts    | Decreasing-amount chains (A→B $10k, B→C $9.5k, C→D $9k) |
| 5 | Structuring            | 18 pts    | Transactions just below reporting thresholds (e.g. $9,900) |
| 6 | Shell Pass-Through     | 15 pts    | Near-zero retention — money in ≈ money out, no economic activity |
| 7 | New Account Burst      | 15 pts    | Freshly created account with sudden high transaction volume |
| 8 | Community / SCC        | 12 pts    | Tightly connected group with heavy internal transfers |
| 9 | Amount Consistency     | 10 pts    | Retention < 5% of throughput |
| 10| Low Entropy            | 10 pts    | Predictable counterparty patterns (Shannon entropy < 1.5) |

#### Score Calculation

```
raw_score = sum of all triggered pattern weights
final_score = min(100, raw_score)     # capped at 100
```

#### Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Score Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔴 HIGH   | ≥ 50        |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 25 – 49     |
| 🟢 LOW    | < 25        |

### 5. False Positive Control
High-degree nodes (≥ 50 connections) with stable timing regularity and no cycle participation receive a **Trust Multiplier** discount (up to 40% reduction).
